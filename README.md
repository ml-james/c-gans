### Plan / Questions / Ideas

* Tidy up the scripts ..?
* Can the scripts be run in such a way that the outputs are presented during training nicely to the user?
* Can the user be given time to completion stats etc. on training. 
* Could the training be done somewhere non-local, e.g. AWS?
* It might be nice if somebody could come along and just take the trained model..?
* Could this project be presented and packaged up to the user somehow... kind of something like a jupyter notebook.
